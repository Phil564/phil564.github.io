		<a>hey once again. I've decided to write this since I feel bad for what I've said. My actions cannot be justified. This seems pretty dramatic, but it's really
		just me looking back at some actions that I think are wrong, but that have been normalized by the majority of the society by now.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>I have acted like a dick on a plenty of occasions during the last 2 years. Those actions of mine were indeed childish.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>After rereading the "Bye bye beta community" page tonight, damn, I realized that it's going to be hard to dissect what I've written that day due
		to my choice of words. It was basically a hate message to the community centered around B3313, a rom hack of Super Mario 64 that I am not really
		able to describe without typing another 100 words so just save your brain cells by searching it on whatever search engine you use.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>I gotta apologize for the threat I sent to Roman once to take down the unabandoned page on RHDC if I didn't get removed off of it. 
		I was still on my baseless hate spree on B3313 back then, and I thought that I had a get out of jail card, but I got humbled hard. 
		I had to spend the next days afterwards trying to get my account unrestricted because of that idiotic move of mine. From my choice of words, you could 
		assume that I am blaming the provider of said "get out of jail card", but it was my decision to get myself in that pond of hot water. I still can't 
		really explain why I did that to this day, I just regret it.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>I would also like to apologize to Roman and Chlorobyte/Benedani, who were nice to me as a person, yet I talked shit about them behind closed doors for no reason.
		Roman was (and probably still is) a great community manager, while Chlorobyte/Benedani is the smart one taking care of the game. I could probably also say the
		same thing about Chris, who has personally done nothing wrong to me as a person. Even if most of the people I've met in the past despite him, I can do nothing
		other than congratulate him for his imagination and determination to finish his game, even in the times where he wasn't feeling like working on it. The only
		cause of the unnecessary hate I had towards them was really just because of a video game that I didn't like. While B3313 still has its flaws (a few poorly designed levels and a 
		repetitive layout), I only hated it because I had my expectations too high when I played the latest version at the time (0.9). I shouldn't have hated the people who worked
		on it AND who play it, just because of that emotion that I have towards the game. It isn't a valid argument in our modern society when criticizing anything. 
		Other than what I've just brought up, I don't have any other true reason (that doesn't involve anything related to personal experiences) to hate on B3313.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>I regret handling the situation like I did. I shouldn't have tried to force my opinion, false judgement, and insults on a bunch of people. It just feels wrong
		after thinking about it over and over.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>I also have to apologize to FlwrPwr and Pichi, who have, again, done nothing bad to me, who I have hated on for basically no reason other than others around me
		hating those people (<- INVALID argument). Instead of solving problems I amplified them.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>I don't really want to get anything out of this other than letting people know that I have changed. Maybe I'll join back the Beehive on some occasions if
		I'm still welcome there, just to see how it is. My Nintendo 64 is already in the closet and I have no intentions of getting it out of there.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>Maybe if I never wrote that page and never left the beta community, perhaps this unhealthy behavior of mine (talking shit about people behind their backs) would've
		been corrected way earlier. Some of you may ask why I am saying this. I am trying to stop bringing this up as much as possible, as it may be counted
		as perpetuating the behavior that I am trying to stop, but essentially, I have been cut off of my main friend group a few months ago. They pointed out that behavior
		of mine and they said they would continue being friends with me, however I feel like they know more than what they want to me to know, but that might just be my paranoia.
		Even if I feel more healthier now, this has been destroying me from the inside. As much as I want to solve this out, the only solution is waiting.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>If only it was that easy to retract statements on the internet.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>My DMs are open to those who are in mutual servers who wish to talk about this whole page that I just wrote. Maybe I'll write another post about my new way of thinking. People have mixed opinions on it.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>Have a good time.</a>
