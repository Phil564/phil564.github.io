		<a>so someone just sent me screenshots of what mr Chlorobyte had to say about me. Normally I wouldn't have replied and I would've coped with it, but that third paragraph... Don't compare me to a fucking doxxer bro. I didn't send images of some of the developer's faces, drop the fucking source 3 times on a youtube account, and bragged about all of that on 4chan.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>also. you didn't have to start a whole ass drama about it. and you don't have to spend unpaid time on this "drama" instead of working on something else for money.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>and not every fucking rom hack has 200k poly models and 4k textures. Have you heard of Beyond the Cursed Mirror by Rovertronic??? I've mentioned this rom hack in my original post, it runs full speed on console, doesn't have that many polygons, and looks pretty vanilla-like.</a>
