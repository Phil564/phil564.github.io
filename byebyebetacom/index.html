		<a>(this was originally written for The Beehive, a server about the slop that is B3313. I wrote this on the night of April 2nd, sent it on April 4th, and updated it on April 5th.)</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>UPDATE: gg i just started drama!!! My response is on <a href="update">another page</a><a>.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>Hello. I am retiring from my role in this server and leaving the whole SM64 Beta sphere. Here's why:</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>First of all. The rom hack sucks. Yeah, even if I have been following the rom hack since July 2021, I think that this hack fucking sucks. Why? Too much fucking sketchup. Broken ass code (chris can't code and the c injection doesn't help). Too many levels (which look like complete ass when you compare them to levels from actual rom hacks such as Rovert's Beyond the Cursed Mirror, Kaze's Return to Yoshi's Island, and many more rom hacks). </a>
		<br><br>
		<a>"oh then why did SimpleFlips and a bunch of other youtubers make videos about the rom hack even if it's ass in your opinion??"</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>They made those videos for views. Lemme tell you why B3313 is so popular. It's because it's BETA. If you remove the beta hud, physics, textures, text, and atmosphere, THEN NO ONE WOULD BE PLAYING B3313. The only thing left would be the huge ass levels. If this was just a normal rom hack, this would be considered as a schizo's piece of art.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>And here's my second point. My "beta" phase is over. When 0.9 came out, I played it a tiny bit (for like 1 hour or something), and I was like "Damn. This is just 0.7 but with functional paintings lmfao. Why did my dumbass wait for this. Where are all of the levels that Chris promised.". And it didn't help that just a month later, the dudes who saved me from Chris's server (you know who you are) showed me the truth behind B3313. And then I looked at beta rom hacks in a different way since that day.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>Oh, and my third point. Y'ALL CAN'T MAKE SHIT :broken_heart: . I'm so disappointed that I've only came across like 2 projects that were showcased in this server that actually looked good (the creator of the first one ended up leaving the server, and the second one ended up being full of stolen stuff). And I'm not gonna start talking about the fucking shitty tapes that y'all have been cooking with those filters.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>My fourth point: the whole saga of "getting the hack to work on console" (no offense to the developers btw)... I've legit told ChloroByte a year ago that removing the Real Time Clock from the rom would make it function on Real Hardware/Console and he NEVER listened. I had to wait till I got the full source history and the time to mess with it, to finally remove the Real Time Clock, and oh.. Surprise suprise!!! I was RIGHT the WHOLE TIME. My flashcart (the ED64+, a clone of the Everdrive 64 V1) doesn't have that feature, and Chlorobyte's implementation wasn't really good... (it kept sending a request to the console for the current Time & Date at each second instead of checking if the feature is present, sending a request once, then managing the time on a separate thread, PROBABLY like Animal Forest (?) ).</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>And I'm not gonna start to ramble about how the Beta Community is full of creeps and children (proof: the beamed accounts that have been posting server invites to CHEESE PIZZA servers in the server).</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>TLDR: y'all can't even cook slop so I'm going to the better rom hacking community. Please play actual rom hacks (like BTCM and Decades Later) instead of slop, or if you still like beta, switch to gamma64.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>Oh, and I have a small gift for you guys who still like that piece of slop.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>Console compatible patches for B3313 20230209 and the Motos Factory Demo. Download them here (xdelta patches for the US release of Super Mario 64 in big endian (z64)): </a><a href="B3313_20230209.xdelta">B3313_20230209.xdelta</a><a>, </a><a href="Motos_Factory_1_3.xdelta">Motos_Factory_1_3.xdelta</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>I'm also unlisting all of my videos about SM64 beta content, and leaving most of the SM64 Beta related servers that are still on my list.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>Goodbye.</a>
